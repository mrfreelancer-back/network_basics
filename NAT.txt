1. the reasons of having NAT(network address translation):
- ipv4 is too few, and its public & private
- too much route using in the world
2. facts about NAT:
-1 NAT changes the destination of packets
-2 NAT changes the source of packets
-3 in NAT each public IP has a private IP
3. when our laptop connects to WIFI, we see that our network card IP is '192.168.10.10'
but, when we search our IP address in google, it is '17.6.145.8'
this means our modem as a router, does the job of PAT every time we connect to the internet
